Before or after reading this guide, read the [Automated Testing
Playbook][playbook] for more context, or the [Testing Cookbook][cookbook] for
more details about the automated testing tools and techniques available for
different languages.

Several of the posts at [The Node Way][node way] also strongly influenced the
design of the application, specifically:

- [Understanding Error-First Callbacks][err-first]
- [Testing Essentials][test ess]
- [Designing Custom Types][types]

For examples of why automated testing is an important part of the social
responsibility of software developers, see:

- [Finding More Than One Worm in the Apple][worm]
- [Goto Fail, Heartbleed, and Unit Testing Culture][culture]
